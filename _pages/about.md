I am a PhD student studying computer engineering in the ECE department at Purdue University. I received my Bachelor's degree in computer engineering from Purdue. Currently, my research topic focuses on microarchitecture side-channels, under the guidance of Professor Torres-Arias Santiago. I am interested in computer architecture and applying machine learning to system and hardware security.
