# Sources

Many of the terms and concepts are borrowed from the following sources:

## Static Executables

  

The creation of static executables has been discouraged for many releases. In fact, 64¨Cbit system archive libraries have never been provided. Because a static executable is built against system archive libraries, the executable contains system implementation details. This self-containment has a number of drawbacks.

  

- The executable is immune to the benefits of system patches delivered as shared objects. The executable therefore, must be rebuilt to take advantage of many system improvements.

- The ability of the executable to run on future releases can be compromised.

- The duplication of system implementation details negatively affects system performance.
