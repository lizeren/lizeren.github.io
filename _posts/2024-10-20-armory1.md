How to use USB Armory MkII (Part 1 Communication)

Since I didn't find very useful and strightforward tutorial on USB Armory MK2, I deceided to write my own.

  

## How to start?

In order to use the USB armory it is possible to either load a Debian linux disk image, or load a program uses Tamago framework on bare metal ARM System-on-Chip (SoC). the latter option allows you to run your program without the support of OS. The eaisest way one should start with is a pre-compiled Debian linux. [Debian for usbarmory ](https://github.com/usbarmory/usbarmory-debian-base_image/releases). You can of course build your the Debian image from the scratch, but I havent done that yet [build from scratch](https://github.com/usbarmory/usbarmory-debian-base_image).

  

## Flash the OS to micro-sd card

[usbarmory-mark-two-usd-debian_bookworm-base_image-20240702.raw.xz](https://github.com/usbarmory/usbarmory-debian-base_image/releases/download/20240702/usbarmory-mark-two-usd-debian_bookworm-base_image-20240702.raw.xz) Once you finish download, unzip it and use _Etcher_ to load the image on a micro-sd card. _Etcher_ is an open-source and free app on Windows OS used for writing image files onto storage media. Loading image under Linux takes a few more steps.

On Linux (verify target from terminal using `dmesg`):
```
sudo dd if=<path to raw file> of=/dev/sdX bs=1M conv=fsync
```

**IMPORTANT**: `<path to raw file>` must be replaced with the _uncompressed_ raw file (e.g. not the .xz file) matching your USB armory model and boot media.

**IMPORTANT**: `/dev/sdX`, `/dev/diskN` must be replaced with your microSD device (not eventual microSD partitions), ensure that you are specifying the correct one. Errors in target specification will result in disk corruption.

**NOTE**: Remember to uncompress the downloaded image file before imaging.

after flashing the OS, plug in the sd card to usbarmory.

  

## Plug in

Now we have an image of Debian linux in the sd card. Before connect usb armory to PC, lets set up debug accessory that comes with the usb armory package. _NOTE_: the connection between the debug accessory and the target is supported only with the same orientation for both top layers (side with components(uart header) for the accessory, side with LEDs for the USB armory). Also, remember to cap the jumper header at the location of uart on the debug accessory PCB. Open up the terminal, use either _screen_ or _picocom_ to monitor the stdout from the usb armory

```bash
sudo  screen  /dev/ttyUSB0  115200
sudo  picocom  -b  115200  -eb  /dev/ttyUSB2  --imap  lfcrlf
```

now connect debug accessory to the mk2 and connect both of them to your pc. you should be able to see the output about booting process, and in the end, login prompt asking for the id and password. the default id and password is usbarmory



```bash
$  lsusb
Bus  001  Device  045:  ID  0525:a4a2  Netchip  Technology,  Inc.  Linux-USB  Ethernet/RNDIS  Gadget
```

## CDC Ethernet
As usbarmory becoming as thernet interface, The PC recognize usbarmory as an ethernet interface. we can interact with the SUB armory just like TCP/IP server through its USB port. When configured for Ethernet operation the USB armory board automatically triggers the relevant host driver to enable TCP/IP communication. The USB armory standard Debian image configures it with IP address 10.0.0.1/24 and default gateway 10.0.0.2. The image comes with a DHCP server enabled by default,

On the host side (mine is a linux machine with Ubuntu)
  #### 1. Enable the USB Ethernet Interface
On the host (Linux machine), bring up the USB virtual Ethernet interface (assuming it's called `usb0`). You may need to adjust `usb0` if the interface name is different.
```bash
/sbin/ip link set usb0 up
```
#### 2. Set a Static IP Address on the Host

Assign the host (your Linux computer) an IP address that the USB Armory can communicate with, such as `10.0.0.2/24`.
```bash
/sbin/ip addr add 10.0.0.2/24 dev usb0
```
#### 3. Enable IP Masquerading for Internet Sharing

To allow the USB Armory to access the internet through your host’s wireless interface (e.g., `wlan0`), you need to enable masquerading on outgoing connections. This command creates a NAT rule that masquerades (hides) the USB Armory’s traffic as if it's coming from your host.
```bash
/sbin/iptables -t nat -A POSTROUTING -s 10.0.0.1/32 -o wlan0 -j MASQUERADE
```
#### 4. Enable IP Forwarding on the Host

To route packets between the USB Armory and other networks (e.g., the internet), you need to enable IP forwarding on the host.
```bash
echo 1 > /proc/sys/net/ipv4/ip_forward
```
On the USB Armory side
#### Configuration Files:

-   Use `lsmod | grep g_ether` to make sure that USB Armory loads the USB Ethernet gadget module.
-   In `/etc/modprobe.d/usbarmory.conf`, you can specify the MAC addresses and other options as mentioned in your example:
```bash
options g_ether use_eem=0 dev_addr=aa:bb:cc:dd:ee:f1 host_addr=aa:bb:cc:dd:ee:f2
```


## Change IP (Network Configuration File)
Unfortunately, my router's IP conflicts the default USB Armory IP. We can change its IP address by modifying the network configuration files directly through UART. 
**Open the Network Configuration File:** On Debian-based systems, network interfaces are typically configured in `/etc/network/interfaces`. Open this file using `vim`.
```bash
sudo vim /etc/network/interfaces
```
**Find the USB Ethernet Interface Configuration:** Look for a section that defines the `usb0` interface or another interface that's used for Ethernet over USB. It might look like this:
```bash
auto usb0
iface usb0 inet static
    address 10.0.0.1
    netmask 255.255.255.0
    network 10.0.0.0
    gateway 10.0.0.2
```
**Change the IP Address:** Replace the default IP address (`10.0.0.1`) with your desired IP address, such as `192.168.100.1`. The updated section might look like this:
```bash
auto usb0
iface usb0 inet static
    address 192.168.100.1
    netmask 255.255.255.0
    network 192.168.100.0
    gateway 192.168.100.2

```
**Restart the Networking Service:** To apply the changes, restart the networking service on the USB Armory.
```bash
sudo systemctl restart networking
```
Alternatively, you can bring down the `usb0` interface and bring it up again:
```bash
sudo ifdown usb0 && sudo ifup usb0
```
**Verify the New IP Address:** You can verify that the new IP address has been applied using the `ip addr` command:
```bash
ip addr show usb0
```
1.  It should now display `192.168.100.1` (or whatever IP you set).

## Change IP (DHCP Server Status)
When I _sudo reboot_ USB Armory, I encountered this error
```bash
[FAILED] Failed to start isc-dhcp-s…er.service - LSB: DHCP server. 
See 'systemctl status isc-dhcp-server.service' for details.
```
To solve this, ensure that the DHCP server is configured to serve the `usb0` interface and is set to provide IP addresses in the range that matches your USB Armory configuration (e.g., `192.168.100.x` range).
### **Check the DHCP Configuration**
The default configuration file is usually located at `/etc/dhcp/dhcpd.conf`
```bash
sudo vim /etc/dhcp/dhcpd.conf
```
```bash
subnet 192.168.100.0 netmask 255.255.255.0 {
    range 192.168.100.10 192.168.100.20;
    option routers 192.168.100.1;
    option broadcast-address 192.168.100.255;
    option domain-name-servers 8.8.8.8, 8.8.4.4;
}
```
Ensure that the DHCP server is bound to the correct interface (`usb0`) by checking `/etc/default/isc-dhcp-server`:
```bash
sudo vim /etc/default/isc-dhcp-server
```
Make sure that the line specifying the interfaces includes `usb0`, like this:
```bash
INTERFACESv4="usb0"
```
### **Test the DHCP Configuration for Syntax Errors**
You can test the DHCP configuration to ensure there are no syntax errors by running:
```bash
sudo dhcpd -t
```
### **Restart the DHCP Server**

After making any changes to the configuration files, restart the `isc-dhcp-server` service:
```bash
sudo systemctl restart isc-dhcp-server
```
Check its status again to ensure it’s running properly:
```bash
systemctl status isc-dhcp-server
```

## Connect via SSH
Now, to ssh to USB Armory, we can simply have 
```bash
ssh usbarmory@192.168.100.1
```
The password is also usbarmory

In the next post, we will talk about how to load and run a single program without Debian OS (no micro SD card or internal Nand required)




## Notes on IP config
**Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP)** is a protocol that automatically assigns IP addresses, subnet masks, gateways, and other network parameters to devices on a network. When a device (like the USB Armory or any computer) is configured to use DHCP, it does not need a statically configured IP address. Instead, it requests one from a DHCP server, which assigns it dynamically.
A DHCP server dynamically assigns an IP address to the device for a specific lease time. This address can change over time.If the device is a client (like your USB Armory), it receives its IP from the DHCP server. You can set up a **DHCP server** on the USB Armory itself (e.g., using `isc-dhcp-server`), or the device can receive an IP address from an external DHCP server (such as from your home router). For the DHCP server, the configuration is usually stored in `/etc/dhcp/dhcpd.conf` (on Debian-based systems). On the client side (USB Armory), to use DHCP, the network interface should be set to `dhcp` in the configuration file.
To set a specific interface (e.g., `usb0`) to use DHCP, the configuration should look like this:

#### 1. **Edit `/etc/network/interfaces`:**

```bash
sudo nano /etc/network/interfaces
```
#### 2. **Set the Interface to Use DHCP:**

Add or modify the relevant section for the interface (`usb0` in this case):
```bash
auto usb0
iface usb0 inet dhcp
```
-   **`auto usb0`**: This ensures that the `usb0` interface will automatically be brought up at boot.
-   **`iface usb0 inet dhcp`**: This configures `usb0` to use DHCP to obtain an IP address automatically.

#### 3. **Restart Networking:**

After editing the file, restart the networking service for the changes to take effect:
```bash
sudo systemctl restart networking
```


**Network Configuration File (Static IP)**
In contrast, **network configuration files** are used for setting up **static** IP addresses and network parameters. This means you manually define the IP address, subnet mask, gateway, and DNS servers that the device will use, and they remain fixed unless you change them manually. In this case, there's no interaction with a DHCP server. All settings are configured locally on the device, and the device won't request an IP from the network.
Since the IP address is fixed, it is useful when the device needs to always have the same IP (e.g., for a server, or for ease of access). On Debian-based systems, the **network configuration file** usually stored in `/etc/network/interfaces`. On newer systems using `Netplan` (Ubuntu), it may be in `/etc/netplan/`
