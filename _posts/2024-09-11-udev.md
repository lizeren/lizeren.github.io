  # udev Rules

I am planning to write a udev rule for my USB driver so that when I plug in my USB drive, the udev rules will be able to identify it and insert a kernel loadable module that enables userspace access to the _Performance Monitors Cycle Count Register_ (**PMCCNTR_EL0**).

## ARMv8 Performance Counters

Accessing **PMCCNTR** requires kernel-level privileges. However, there is a register, **PMUSERENR_EL0**, that enables user-mode access to cycle counters. By setting bit 0 and bit 2 of **PMUSERENR_EL0** to 1 [ARM Docs](https://developer.arm.com/documentation/102670/0300/AArch64-registers/AArch64-register-descriptions/AArch64-Performance-Monitors-register-description/PMUSERENR-EL0--Performance-Monitors-User-Enable-Register), user-level EL0 can access and read the performance counter. The source code for this kernel module can be found here. [ARMv8 Performance Counters management module](https://github.com/lizeren/armv8_pmu_cycle_counter_el0/blob/master/armv8_pmu_el0_cycle_counter.c)


## Shell script 
This shell script will be invoked by udev when a device is detected and matched by the rule
  
```bash
#!/bin/bash
/bin/date  >>  /tmp/udev.log
echo  "Script triggered by udev"  >>  /tmp/udev.log
# Check if the module file exists
MODULE_PATH="/home/lizeren/Desktop/armv8_pmu_cycle_counter_el0/pmu_el0_cycle_counter.ko"
if [ !  -f  "$MODULE_PATH" ]; then
	echo  "Error: Module $MODULE_PATH not found."  >>  /tmp/udev.log
	exit  1
fi
# Load the kernel module using sudo insmod
echo  "Loading kernel module $MODULE_PATH..."  >>  /tmp/udev.log
sudo  insmod  "$MODULE_PATH"
# Check if the module was loaded successfully
if  lsmod  |  grep  -q  "pmu_el0_cycle_counter"; then
	echo  "Module loaded successfully!"  >>  /tmp/udev.log
else
	echo  "Failed to load module."  >>  /tmp/udev.log
fi
```
Place this in  **/usr/local/bin**  or some such place in the default executable path. Call it <mark>trigger.sh</mark>
and, of course, make it executable with  **chmod +x**.
```text
$ sudo mv trigger.sh /usr/local/bin
$ sudo chmod +x /usr/local/bin/trigger.sh
```
Notice that the debugging prints are redirected to _**/tmp/udev.log**_, so the script logs when it has been successfully triggered. The usual location for log files is the **/var** directory, but that is primarily the root user's domain. For testing purposes, use **/tmp**, which is accessible to normal users and is typically cleaned out upon reboot.


## Define udev rules
Udev identifies devices by serial numbers, manufacturers, vendor ID and product ID numbers etc. In our case, my usb is Kingston DataTraveler 3.0 so i use **lsusb** for displaying information about USB buses in the system and the devices connected to them.
```text
$ lsusb
sda           8:0    1  28.9G  0 disk 
└─sda1        8:1    1  28.9G  0 part /media/lizeren/ESD-USB

```
Or, unplug and plug your thumb drive back in, then immediately issue this command:
```text
$ sudo dmesg | tail
[16036.796284] usb-storage 2-7:1.0: USB Mass Storage device detected
[16036.796712] scsi host4: usb-storage 2-7:1.0
[16037.825918] scsi 4:0:0:0: Direct-Access     Kingston DataTraveler 3.0 PMAP PQ: 0 ANSI: 6
[16037.826560] sd 4:0:0:0: Attached scsi generic sg0 type 0
[16037.827049] sd 4:0:0:0: [sda] 60555264 512-byte logical blocks: (31.0 GB/28.9 GiB)
[16037.827309] sd 4:0:0:0: [sda] Write Protect is off
[16037.827313] sd 4:0:0:0: [sda] Mode Sense: 45 00 00 00
[16037.827497] sd 4:0:0:0: [sda] Write cache: disabled, read cache: enabled, doesn't support DPO or FUA
[16038.111915]  sda: sda1
[16038.125991] sd 4:0:0:0: [sda] Attached SCSI removable disk
```
you know the kernel has assigned your thumb drive the **sda** label. More specifically, **sda1**
Now, it is time to use **udevadm info** to pick out parts of udev's report about a device that are most unique to that device, then tell udev to trigger your script when those unique attributes are detected.
```text
$ udevadm info -a -n /dev/sda1 
or 
$ udevadm info --attribute-walk --name=/dev/sda1
```
The **udevadm info** process reports on a device (specified by the device path), then "walks" up the chain of parent devices. For every device found, it prints all possible attributes using a key-value format. You can compose a rule to match according to the attributes of a device plus attributes from one single parent device.  
```text
looking at device '/devices/pci0000:00/0000:00:14.0/usb2/2-7/2-7:1.0/host4/target4:0:0/4:0:0:0/block/sda/sda1':
    KERNEL=="sda1"
    SUBSYSTEM=="block"
    DRIVER==""
    ATTR{discard_alignment}=="0"
    ATTR{ro}=="0"
    ATTR{alignment_offset}=="0"
    ATTR{size}=="60553216"
    ATTR{partition}=="1"
```
***<mark>A udev rule must contain one attribute from one single parent device.</mark>***

Parent attributes are things that describe a device from the most basic level, such as  _it's something that has been plugged into a physical port_  or  _it is something with a size_  or  _this is a removable device_.
This is sda1's parent attributes. you notice any difference?
```text
looking at parent device '/devices/pci0000:00/0000:00:14.0/usb2/2-7/2-7:1.0/host4/target4:0:0/4:0:0:0/block/sda':
    KERNELS=="sda"
    SUBSYSTEMS=="block"
    DRIVERS==""
    ATTRS{ext_range}=="256"
    ATTRS{capability}=="51"
    ATTRS{alignment_offset}=="0"
    ATTRS{events}=="media_change"
    ATTRS{inflight}=="       0        0"
    ATTRS{size}=="60555264"
    ATTRS{discard_alignment}=="0"
    ATTRS{hidden}=="0"
    ATTRS{removable}=="1"
    ATTRS{ro}=="0"
    ATTRS{range}=="16"
    ATTRS{events_async}==""
    ATTRS{events_poll_msecs}=="-1"
```
Te key of Parent attributes are all plural. Below is how ***udevadm info -a -n /dev/sda1*** outputs the hierarchy
```text
looking at device '/devices/pci0000:00/0000:00:14.0/usb2/2-7/2-7:1.0/host4/target4:0:0/4:0:0:0/block/sda/sda1':

looking at parent device '/devices/pci0000:00/0000:00:14.0/usb2/2-7/2-7:1.0/host4/target4:0:0/4:0:0:0/block/sda':

looking at parent device '/devices/pci0000:00/0000:00:14.0/usb2/2-7/2-7:1.0/host4/target4:0:0/4:0:0:0':

looking at parent device '/devices/pci0000:00/0000:00:14.0/usb2':

looking at parent device '/devices/pci0000:00/0000:00:14.0':

looking at parent device '/devices/pci0000:00':
```
Now the rule for identifying my Kingston DataTraveler 3.0 is simple. Open a file called  **80-local.rules**  in  **/etc/udev/rules.d**  and enter this code:
```code
SUBSYSTEM=="block",KERNEL == "sda1" ,ATTRS{vendor}=="Kingston",ACTION=="add", RUN+="/usr/local/bin/trigger.sh"

```
Theoretically, you need **sudo udevadm control --reload-rules**  to activate the rule. But I found out in my system, the rules are automatically applied. 
## Testing
The easiest way to test is unplug-plug your usb device, and check the log file
```text
$ cat /tmp/udev.log
Wed Sep 11 12:05:29 EDT 2024
Script triggered by udev
Module loaded successfully!
```
If you are lazy and don't want to unplug-plug, you can do 

```text
sudo udevadm trigger --action=add --subsystem-match=block --property-match=DEVNAME=/dev/sda1
```
This command manually triggers a udev event for a specific block device (`/dev/sda1`) by simulating the addition of that device. Here’s a breakdown of the options used:

-   `sudo`: Runs the command with superuser privileges, which is necessary since udev-related tasks typically require elevated permissions.
    
-   `udevadm trigger`: This command is used to manually trigger events that the udev system handles automatically when hardware changes occur (such as adding or removing devices). Here, we are using it to simulate the addition of a device.
    
-   `--action=add`: Specifies the action to simulate. In this case, `add` simulates the event as if the block device `/dev/sda1` was just plugged in.
    
-   `--subsystem-match=block`: Filters the event so that it only applies to devices in the `block` subsystem, which includes block devices such as hard drives, USB drives, and partitions.
    
-   `--property-match=DEVNAME=/dev/sda1`: Specifies the exact device to match based on its device name. In this case, it targets the block device located at `/dev/sda1`, which might represent a specific partition of a hard drive or a USB device.

## Debuging Tips
When I wrote and tested this rule, sometimes the rule would be triggered twice. To find more detailed information, you can also increase the verbosity of the udev logs temporarily by setting the log level to 

`sudo udevadm control --log-priority=debug` 

Then check the system logs (usually `/var/log/syslog` or `journalctl`) for detailed output:

`sudo journalctl -f` 
Here is my log [Link to GitHub](). you can search `RUN '/usr/local/bin/trigger.sh'`  in the log, and there are exact two results. The `/usr/local/bin/trigger.sh` script is being called twice because it is triggered by two different devices: `sda` and `sda1`. These are two distinct device nodes:
-   `sda` refers to the entire USB drive (the physical device).
-   `sda1` refers to the first partition on that USB drive.
So that's why the rule has `KERNEL == "sda1` to exclude rule matching by sda

After you're done, remember to reset the log level: 
`sudo udevadm control --log-priority=info`
