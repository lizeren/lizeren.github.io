We don't always need operating system support to run a program. For example, you can interface with USB Mass Storage directly.
## Loading a Single Program to USB Armory Mk II

Without the SD card, here’s how the host identifies the USB Armory:
```bash
$  lsusb
Bus  001  Device  020:  ID  0403:6011  Future  Technology  Devices  International,  Ltd  FT4232H  Quad  HS  USB-UART/FIFO  IC
Bus  001  Device  044:  ID  15a2:0080  Freescale  Semiconductor,  Inc.  SE  Blank  6ULL
```
This message indicates that the Mk II is in Serial Download Protocol (SDP) mode. Let’s flash a program onto the USB Armory using [armory-ums](https://github.com/usbarmory/armory-ums/tree/master). This TamaGo-based unikernel enables USB Mass Storage interfacing for both the USB Armory Mk II's internal eMMC card and any inserted external microSD card.

Before jumping into the loading process, let’s discuss the tool used to load the executable image.

## armory-boot
This tool implements a minimal version of the Serial Download Protocol (SDP), used on NXP i.MX SoC application processors, to load an executable image over USB. It is aimed at [USB Armory Mk II](https://github.com/usbarmory/usbarmory/wiki) users but should work with all i.MX series SoCs that support USB HID-based SDP.

The [mfgtools](https://github.com/NXPmicro/mfgtools) and [imx_usb_loader](https://github.com/boundarydevices/imx_usb_loader) projects also offer similar functionality.

To install armory-boot, follow the instructions on the official GitHub page: [armory-boot-usb](https://github.com/usbarmory/armory-boot/tree/master/cmd/armory-boot-usb). If you download, compile, and install the utility under your GOPATH, you can run the following command:
```go
go install github.com/usbarmory/armory-boot/cmd/armory-boot-usb@latest
``` 
On my machine, I invoke the tool like this:
```bash
sudo $HOME/go/bin/armory-boot-usb -i armory-ums.imx
```
Alternatively you can manually compile it from source:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/usbarmory/armory-boot
cd armory-boot && make armory-boot-usb
```

## TamaGo compiler
We need the TamaGo compiler to build the `armory-ums.imx` application executable.
To build the TamaGo compiler (or use the latest binary release), run the following:
```bash
wget https://github.com/usbarmory/tamago-go/archive/refs/tags/latest.zip
unzip latest.zip
cd tamago-go-latest/src && ./all.bash
cd ../bin && export TAMAGO=`pwd`/go
```
Now, build the `armory-ums.imx` application executable:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/usbarmory/armory-ums && cd armory-ums
make CROSS_COMPILE=arm-none-eabi- imx
```
The original Makefile had an issue with the `TAMAGO_PATH`. I modified it to use the absolute path. You can check the updated Makefile [here](https://github.com/lizeren/armory-spoofer/blob/main/Makefile).

## Verify
When you run the following command:
```bash
sudo armory-boot-usb -i armory-ums.imx
```
You should see the following output, indicating that the program was flashed successfully:
```python
found device 15a2:0080 Freescale Semiconductor Inc SE Blank 6ULL
parsing armory-ums.imx
loading DCD at 0x00910000 (952 bytes)
loading imx to 0x9000f400 (2182144 bytes)
jumping to 0x9000f400
serial download complete
```
On the host machine, verify the flash process by running `_lsblk_`. You should see a new block device, `sda`, with a size of approximately 14 GB.
