How to set up TSEL(Flatcar Container Linux)

## Install conda

```bash
cd ~
wget https://repo.anaconda.com/miniconda/Miniconda3-latest-Linux-x86_64.sh
bash Miniconda3-latest-Linux-x86_64.sh
```

Because ~/.bashrc is read only, we need to manually exporting the PATH each time to run conda

```bash
export PATH="$HOME/miniconda3/bin:$PATH"
# Test
which conda
```
## Install GCC

```bash
conda install -c conda-forge gcc gxx make
```
