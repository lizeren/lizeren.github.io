#  Dynamic linker hijacking

  This post will explain the implementation details and the reason that why dynamic linker hijacking works. The content and source code is based on [Linux rootkits explained – Part 1: Dynamic linker hijacking](https://www.wiz.io/blog/linux-rootkits-explained-part-1-dynamic-linker-hijacking). I recommend reading the original post first.

## Implementation
Here is a C implementation of the attack. Before explaining the code, let's understand the techcnique behind.
```c
#define _GNU_SOURCE
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>
#include <dlfcn.h>
#include <dirent.h>
#include <string.h>
// Function pointer typedef for the original readdir ls function
typedef struct dirent* (*ls_t)(DIR*);
// Interposed ls function
struct dirent* readdir(DIR* dirp) {
  // Get the original readdir address
  ls_t original_readdir = (ls_t)dlsym(RTLD_NEXT, "readdir");
  struct dirent* entry;
  do {
    // Call the original ls function to get the next directory entry
    entry = original_readdir(dirp);
    // Check if the entry is the file we want to hide
    if (entry != NULL && strcmp(entry->d_name, "malicious_file") == 0) {
      // Skip the file by calling the original ls function again
      entry = original_readdir(dirp);
    }
  } while (entry != NULL && strcmp(entry->d_name, "malicious_file") == 0);
  return entry;
}
```

### Dynamic Linking and Symbol Resolution
When a dynamically linked executable is run:
1.  The dynamic loader (`ld.so`) loads all required shared objects (e.g., libc.so , the standard C library) into the process's address space.
2.  Function calls are resolved to the correct memory addresses based on the dynamic linking symbols.
3. **`LD_PRELOAD` Changes This Process:
When `LD_PRELOAD` is set, it tells the dynamic loader to load the specified shared library (e.g., `libhijackls.so`, the shared library that the code above compiled to) **before** other shared libraries (like `libc.so`).
This affects symbol resolution: functions defined in the `LD_PRELOAD` library take precedence over functions in the original shared objects.

### Main Idea of the Implementation
  **Function Redefinition:**
    In the shared library (`libhijackls.so`), we define a custom implementation of `readdir`.
 **Symbol Precedence via `LD_PRELOAD`:**
When `LD_PRELOAD=./libhijackls.so` is set, the dynamic loader sees that your shared library should be loaded **first**.
       This means any call to `readdir` in the process (e.g., by the `ls` command) will use your custom `readdir` instead of the original `libc.so` version.
  **Accessing the Original `readdir`:**
   Even though your `readdir` overrides the original, the original function still exists in memory (in `libc.so`).
     You can explicitly access the original function using `dlsym` with the `RTLD_NEXT` flag.
 ```c
ls_t original_readdir = (ls_t)dlsym(RTLD_NEXT, "readdir");
```
`RTLD_NEXT` tells `dlsym` to look for the next occurrence of `readdir` **after** the current library (`libhijackls.so`) in the dynamic linking chain. This ensures you bypass your custom `readdir` and call the original `libc.so` version.
**Calling the Original Function:**
With the function pointer returned by `dlsym`, you can call the original `readdir`
```c
struct dirent* entry = original_readdir(dirp);
```

### Syntax and Code breakdown
**Function pointer declaration**
Defines a function pointer type (`ls_t`) for the `readdir` function
```c
typedef struct dirent* (*ls_t)(DIR*);
```
`*ls_t` is a pointer to a function, a programmer-defined identifier.
**`struct dirent*`**: The return type of the function (`readdir`), which is a pointer to a `struct dirent` (structure representing a directory entry).
**`(DIR*)`**: Specifies the argument type of the function, which is a pointer to a `DIR` structure (representing an open directory).
when we need to declare a function pointer for this specific type, you would write:
```c
ls_t original_readdir;
```

**Function definition**
```c
struct dirent* readdir(DIR* dirp) {
}
```
This definition is the same as [readdir(3) — Linux manual page](https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man3/readdir.3.html). 
#### 1. **`struct dirent*`**:

-   **Return Type**: This function returns a pointer to a `struct dirent`.
-   **`struct dirent`**: Represents a directory entry in C. It typically contains fields like the name of the file (`d_name`) and other metadata.
The `struct dirent` is defined in `<dirent.h>` and varies slightly between systems. A typical definition include
```c
struct dirent {
    ino_t          d_ino;       // Inode number
    off_t          d_off;       // Offset to the next dirent
    unsigned short d_reclen;    // Length of this record
    unsigned char  d_type;      // Type of file
    char           d_name[256]; // Null-terminated filename
};
```

#### 2. **`readdir(DIR* dirp)`**:

-   **Function Signature**: The function takes a pointer to a `DIR` structure as its argument.
-   **`DIR* dirp`**: Represents an open directory stream, obtained by calling `opendir()`.

#### 3. **What `readdir` Does**:
-   Reads the next entry from the directory stream.
-   Returns a pointer to a `struct dirent` describing the entry, or `NULL` if no more entries are available.

The rest of the code are easy to understand:
```c
ls_t original_readdir = (ls_t)dlsym(RTLD_NEXT, "readdir");
```
LIne above finds the address of the next `readdir` function in the shared object search order (i.e., the original `readdir`).
```c
if (entry != NULL && strcmp(entry->d_name, "malicious_file") == 0) { 
// Skip the file by calling the original readdir function again entry = original_readdir(dirp); 
}
```
When it encounters a directory entry with the name `"malicious_file"`, the condition `strcmp(entry->d_name, "malicious_file") == 0` evaluates to `true`.
Instead of returning this entry to the calling program (e.g., `ls`), the custom `readdir` function calls the original `readdir` function **again** to fetch the next directory entry.
This effectively "hides" the `"malicious_file"` entry by not letting it be seen by the calling program. Basically, the do while loop will terminate immediately If a directory entry is not named `"malicious_file"`
